            <h1>Hello!</h1>
            <h2>I’m Caroline, an illustrator and Communication Design student at Washington University in St. Louis, with a secondary focus in Art History.</h2>
            <p>My illustration practice grows from a deep appreciation of nature and botanical forms, drawing inspiration from the organic elegance of Art Nouveau. These influences shape my exploration of themes such as nourishment, strength, and care as reflected in the female body.</p>
            <p>While in St. Louis, I work as an illustrator for <a href="https://www.arcmag.org">ARC Magazine</a>, creating engaging visuals that bring complex political and religious topics to life. When I’m home in New York, I work as a graphic designer for <a class="katonah">Katonah Wine & Liquor,</a> developing website visuals and a monthly newsletter that has helped expand the store’s customer base. I also work as an artist’s assistant at <a href="https://www.sherwoodforestdesign.com">Sherwood Forest Design</a>, where I hand-paint artisanal wooden bowls, an experience that has deepened my appreciation for the decorative arts and the sentimental value of handmade work.</p>
