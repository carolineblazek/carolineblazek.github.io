            <h1>Hello!</h1>
            <h2>My name is Caroline and I am an illustrator studying Communication Design in St. Louis, Missouri.</h2>
            <p> I am currently pursuing a BFA in Communication Design with a second major in Art History at Washington University in St. Louis. My illustration work grows from a deep appreciation of botanical forms and a celebration of the nourishment, strength, and care reflected in the female body.
            <br>    
            When I am back home in New York, I work as a painter and artist's assistant at Sherwood Forest Design, which has taught me much about the sentimental value of the decorative arts. I otherwise work in graphic design and have completed branding and web design projects for several local businesses in Westchester.</p>
